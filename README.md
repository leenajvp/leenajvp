UI deveoper, who also enjoys all other aspects of game development including VR and gameplay programming. I am passionate about accessibility, UX and the psychology behind creating video games, I genuinely enjoy researching about these topics and spend a lot of my time reading on them.

My projects have been mainly created in Unity using C# and often following Agile Development patterns.
