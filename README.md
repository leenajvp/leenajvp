I am soon to be graduating Games Design and Development University student. I am mainly a generalist programmer but am also interested in UI programming. I am passionate about accessibility for games, user experience and the psychology behind creating video games, I genuinely enjoy researching about these topics and spend a lot of my time reading on them.

My projects have been mainly created in Unity using C# and often following Agile Development patterns. I am also currently taking an Unreal and C++ online course on the side of my studies.
