I am soon to be graduating Games Design and Development University student. I am mainly a generalist programmer but am also interested in UI programming. I am passionate about accessibility for games, user experience and the psychology behind creating video games, I genuinely enjoy researching about these topics and spend a lot of my time reading on them.
